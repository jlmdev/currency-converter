# Currency Converter

## Problem

- Create a page that loads and shows the current currency conversion rates.
- Design the page yourself or use utility CSS libraries like: Bootstrap or Bulma or Tailwind
- Use USD as the base currency.
- Allow the user to enter a currency amount (allow for decimal amounts like 42.12) in USD.
- Show the converted amount in each of the available currencies.
- Either update as the user types or include a button that performs the conversion when clicked.
- Show the currency only two decimal places. For example, do not show 42.123456789 only show 42.12 -- You may need this method to help. How is your code dealing with the truncation? Is it rounding? Is it rounding fairly? How might you change this behavior?
